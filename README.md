# Pekkis' Hardcore React Training

## Introduction

Welcome to my two day React Workshop. It is very important
that you read and follow these instructions **before** the actual two training
days.

## Human Requirements

- You are a developer, devsigner or such.
- You have working professional knowledge on JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
  You don't have to be a guru, but the course really is not meant for
  beginners.

## Computer Requirements

- MacOS, Linux or Windows all work.
  - In Windows, this works at least in WSL 2. I often use that myself when hobby coding.
    Native Windows? I have no clue.
  - If it doesn't work, just boot it up in some Linux virtual machine.
- Current stable version of Node.js (16.x) and a "normal" default version of `NPM` that comes bundled with the Node version (8.x). It might work on older
  or newer Node versions too, but no guarantees! Use `nvm` for example to manage multiple Node versions.
- An editor / IDE that supports all the good stuff. I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) myself, and because of the LiveShare code sharing env, you probably should too during this training.

## Installation

Start by forking / cloning this repository.

`main` is the default branch that contains the starting point for
our course.

There are lots of other branches too. These contain the code I've done
in most of the previous courses I've teached and while preparing the material. Interesting stuff, at least if you're
hungry for nostalgia and how the scene has changed!

### Browser extensions

You should install these Chrome extensions, or similar ones for your browser of choice.

- [React dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)

### VSCode extensions

You should install at least the following extensions.

- ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- Prettier - Code formatter (esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- EditorConfig for VS Code (editorconfig.editorconfig)
- Live Share Extension Pack (ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack)
- vscode-styled-components (jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components)
- stylelint (stylelint.vscode-stylelint)

I also seem to have these potentially relevant ones, so if you want feature
parity please install them too.

- Visual Studio IntelliCode (visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode)
- GitLens â€” Git supercharged (eamodio.gitlens)

Some extensions you might already have could conflict with these, so please
try to check that everything is a-ok. Also if you have good extensions that
I should use in addition / replacing one of these, please holler!

## How to

### Develop

- `npm install`
- `cp .env.example .env`
- `npm run start`

Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (if that is reserved for some reason, you might get another port but the terminal should tell you that).
You should see a "beautiful" welcoming screen that contains a duckling and might suggest that some people like suckling on ducklings.

There should be more instructions / assertions on the screen. Please read carefully. If you're happy with what you see, you're done.

### Build

- `npm run build`

Look at `dist/` folder.

## Licensing

Use as you wish. Read the license from LICENSE.
